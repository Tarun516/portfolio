      "A responsive web application built with React and Next.js. Features include authentication, data visualization, and real-time updates.",
    fullDescription: `
      This project was built to solve the problem of visualizing complex data sets in a user-friendly way. 
      
      The application features a responsive dashboard with real-time updates, interactive charts, and a robust authentication system. Users can filter data, export reports, and customize their dashboard view.
      
      The tech stack includes:
      - Next.js for the frontend framework
      - React Query for data fetching and caching
      - Tailwind CSS for styling
      - Recharts for data visualization
      - NextAuth.js for authentication
      
      One of the biggest challenges was implementing real-time updates without affecting performance. This was solved by using a combination of WebSockets and optimistic UI updates.
